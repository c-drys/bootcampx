-- The HAVING clause is like WHERE but works on aggregated data.
--  Our WHERE clause works on normal data students.end_date and 
-- our HAVING clause works on the aggregated data count(assignment_submissions.*)

-- The HAVING clause is evaluated before the SELECT so we can't use the alias total_submissions alias that is created in the SELECT

SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
WHERE students.end_date IS NULL
GROUP BY students.name
HAVING count(assignment_submissions.*) < 100;
